Quiz game for the "Flutter Vikings" event. The entire project has been created using Flutter, Dart and the ["Bloc"](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc) state management library by Felix Angelov. In this simple game, you're asked to answer a series of questions in the shortest possible time to climb the leaderboard and reach the first position:

  - questions will be about Dart 2.10.4 and Flutter 1.22;
  - in order to join the quiz, you'll need to get a free conference [ticket](https://fluttervikings.com/);
  - you can't play the quiz more than once.
  
Once you clone this repo, you can run unit and widget tests calling `flutter test` and integration tests as well calling `flutter driver --target=test_driver/app.dart`.
